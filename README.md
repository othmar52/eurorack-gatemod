# eurorack gate nudger

arduino based eurorack module to add or remove single gate pulses  
very useful in combination with the TuringMachine (https://github.com/TomWhitwell/TuringMachine)  
this module gives us the possibility to nudge a locked sequence left and right on the "timeline" by adding or supressing sigle gate pulses  
further it is possible to increase the gate length with a potentiometer
